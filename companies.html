        Vernicht
        Systemic risk & stress intelligence
        Vernicht models how complex institutional systems behave under stress 
        — including liquidity shocks, policy changes, and cascading failures
        . It helps institutions understand where systems break first, why they break, 
        and which interventions stabilise them.

       How Vernicht uses Father SAI?
       Father SAI synthesises Vernicht’s stress models with real‑time constraints from the broader Providence ecosystem. 
        This allows Vernicht to move beyond raw simulations and deliver interpretable, decision‑ready explanations 
        to policymakers and risk committees, rather than opaque model outputs.
